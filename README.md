# Simple-ggmap-Script

I have to make a map of WLT for my 4th year report and it was suggested to me that I should add my script here afterwards. I am very grateful for Sarah Salisbury's help in supplying links to instructions on how to use ggmap with API. If you are wanting to use this script, you will first need a free API account to get your API key as mine likely will not work for you.

This is just a very simple script for making maps using ggmap. It is not my neatest code and I will probably return to it to spruce it up before I use it in my report. 
But it works for now.

If anyone knows how to add a scale bar, that would be a great addition.
